title:  "Taking a Step Back from Oden"

I have decided to stop working on Oden.

Why? Building a programming language, even a small one as Oden where I can
piggy-back on the success and engineering efforts of Go, takes a lot of time.
*A lot of time.* I currently work professionally at a startup called
[Empear](https://codescene.com/) where we develop products for analyzing and
understanding large software projects based on their history. The work is a lot
of fun, but also takes much of my time and energy. Working with something as
demanding as Oden on nights and weekends, at least in the long run, is
unrealistic for me. I managed to keep a good pace during the spring of 2016,
but since this summer the tempo has steadily declined into spurious efforts
every other week or so. While that may be fine in many open-source projects, I
think Oden needs a far better momentum if it is to be usable in any forseeable
future.

I have wrestled with these thoughts for some time now, trying to find ways not
to put the project on the shelf. Gathering and building a community of people
is not easy. Neither is having the stamina to work on a project alone for an
extended period of time. If I cannot build it alone, and if I cannot rally the
group of people needed to build it together, then I should focus my efforts
elsewhere. In other words, I should find something to work on that fits my
current work situation and private life better.

Summarizing the year of 2016, it has been a hell of a ride. I went from only
having talked at internal company events, to presenting at a local user group,
and finally being a speaker on PolyConf in Poznań, Curry On in Rome, and
Lambda World in Cádiz! I have learned a lot about programming language
design, compiler implementation, open-source project management, project
marketing, and blogging. Regardless if you build something that "succeeds",
whatever that means, I can highly recommend building your own language and
compiler. It such a joy seeing your own little creature taking shape, running
the first *Hello World*, writing the documentation, and meeting people that
are excited about your work.  There are negative sides as well, at least if
you publish your work. The haters will find you and do their best to bring
you down. I was shocked by that experience, loosing sleep and feeling really
bad about myself.  Eventually, though, I got out of it and started seeing all
the wonderful reactions and encouragements from people around me, especially
at conferences. That almost became a shock in itself! "Are people really this
excited about my little language project?"

All of this has come together as a challenging balance for me -- a balance
between doing Oden for my own sake, a way of learning more about designing and
building a programming language, and doing it for other people and for the Go
community. I have reached a turning point and I will stop here. This post may
seem as an attempt of creating some drama, which is not the point. I think it
is reasonable for me to be clear why I am doing this, and to avoid any false
expectations on the project's future.

The Oden source code will remain at GitHub, with a big disclaimer that it is no
longer in active development. I will shut down [oden-lang.org](https://oden-lang.org/)
and associated sites this week as I am paying for the servers myself. I might
transfer the latest User Guide to a GitHub Pages site for free hosting.

As a final note, I still think the Go ecosystem deserves a decent functional
programming language. Maybe some new language will emerge and fill those shoes,
or a backend for PureScript or OCaml can win some ground.  What ever the
turnout, if Oden played even the smallest part in that story, I would be very
happy.
